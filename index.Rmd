Recent advances in bioinformatics, computational biology, and the
ever-growing scale of omics datasets have created an urgent need for
efficient, reproducible, and scalable data processing that aligns with
FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles.
nf-core addresses this need by providing a rich collection of
community-curated, best-practice pipelines for secondary analysis across
a wide range of omics domains. By leveraging nf-core, researchers can
streamline complex analyses, ensure reproducibility, and focus more on
biological insights rather than computational overhead.

While this workshop will provide a brief introduction to Nextflow, and
nf-core with a demostration of the `nf-core/rnaseq` pipeline, nf-core
offers workflows/pipelines for 80+ use-cases, with many more under
development. To learn more about nf-core, please visit:
